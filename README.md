### Project Title
*US Bikeshare Data*

### Description
This amazing project allows us to consult the data of the well-known system of the United States for Bicycle-sharing which was carried out in three important cities of this country, allowing us to check and compare

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
In addition to the gender of the person and the Birth Year to verify between which ages the use of this service is more popular.
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.🚲

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.🌞💻

In this project, it is used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. It compares the system usage between three large cities: _Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC_.🏙
